  The objective of the game is to move his/her king piece to the central "King's Valley" tile.
  <br><br>The game starts with the player with white pieces moving first followed by the black player and so on.
  <br><br>The players take turns to move one of their pieces.All pieces move in the same way: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.There are no captures and pieces can't jump other pieces.
  <br><br>Pieces continue their movement until, and only until, they reach a vacant square adjacent to (or alongside) either the edge of the board or another piece, at which point the movement ends.
Stopping in the middle of a “slide,” as is done in chess, is not allowed.
<br><br>The only piece the players may stop at the center square is the King. But again, the player may not do so by stopping the King's movement “mid-slide.”
<br><br>The player going first must, for the first move of the game, move a Soldier.
<br><br>Passing a turn is illegal. No one can pass the turn and must move anyone of the pieces.
<br><br>If King is fixed on the square he can't move at next turn the game is lost.
<br><br> Post clicking a piece, the green circles show the available moves for a piece and the orange squares show the latest movement by a piece.
